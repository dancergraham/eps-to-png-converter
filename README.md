⚠️WARNING doesn't work - built as a challenge in response to (this toot)[https://mastodon.social/@AlSweigart/114094567662879884] 

To convert an EPS file to a PNG file using the `eps_to_png.py` script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download the `eps_to_png.py` script to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where the `eps_to_png.py` script is located.
5. Run the script with the following command:

```sh
python eps_to_png.py input.eps output.png
```

Replace `input.eps` with the path to your EPS file and `output.png` with the desired output PNG file path.
